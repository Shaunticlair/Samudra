# Samudra ðŸŒŠ
This repository contains the code of the Samudra Ocean Emulator described in the paper ["Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795). Samudra is a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth.

### Key features

âœ… Reliable: Capable of reproducing the temperature structure and variability of a realistic 3D ocean climate model

</p>

âœ… Stable: run for multiple centuries in a realistic configuration with time-dependent forcing while maintaining stability and accuracy 

âœ… Fast: it is ðŸš…150 times fasterðŸš… than its original counterpart 

âœ… Open: Samudra is available on Hugging Face. Anyone can now run a global ocean emulator! 

## TODO

- [ ] Using HuggingFace data is currently very slow to generate a rollout, need a better method.
- [x] Add # Samudra content 
- [ ] Add visual aids (Rollout Video / Model arch fig), maybe https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S0rA0pUZWi4B0YlNztiLKCwRhGrBcbIX/view?resourcekey
- [ ] Fix environment.yml
- [x] Fix citation
- [ ] Code refactor / cleanup (?)
- [ ] HuggingFace ReadMEs
- [ ] Training code


### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Create a new conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.
3. Run the notebook `samudra_rollout.ipynb` to see how to generate a rollout with trained model weights.

### Model Weights
The model weights can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/M2LInES/Samudra).

### Data
The data used in the paper can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/M2LInES/Samudra_OM4). See the paper for more details on the data.
